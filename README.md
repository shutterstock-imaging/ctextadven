IMPORTANT

rewriting everything to be in proper formatting and different files/libraries. Expect zero updates for a few days. 


I have rewritten most of the code and it is now in a usable state, will be reimplementing objects and locations soon.

Text adventure I'm making for fun and learning. Expect plenty of bugs and not much features, will try to update here and there

compile the program with a compiler such as gcc or clang, should work on most nix operating systems and windows.
